## Overview
W. Avy, a potential entrepreneur keen to lure investors for his startup business of a surf and ice cream shop, requested additional weather analysis to better determine whether this business would be sustainable year-round. In the initial analysis, we looked at precipitation in Oahu and determined that, although frequent, levels were insignificant to deter water activities or the enjoyment of frozen treats. In this analysis we looked at temperature bi-annual temperatures over an 8-year period. We extracted all June and December temperatures for comparison.
- Data source: Hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Jupyter Notebooks, conda 4.12.0, Python 3.7.3, VS Code 1.67.2
## Results
-	There were more recorded temperature observations in June at 1700 compared with December at 1517
-	The mean and median temperatures for both June and December were nearly identical. The mean and median for June was 74.9 degrees and 75 degrees respectively while December mean and median temperatures were 71 degrees for both. 

June Temperatures

-	The spread between minimum and maximum temperatures was greater in December where recorded highs were 83 degrees and lows at 56 degrees. In June the minimum and maximum were separated by 21 degrees with highs reported at 85 degrees and lows at 64 degrees.

December Temperatures

## Summary
After reviewing the results, based on temperatures it is likely that surf and ice cream shop would do well in both the summer and winter months. Although cooler, the temperatures in December remain acceptable for both outdoor activities and ice cream. The average temperatures for both June and December were nearly 75 degrees and 71 degrees respectively. The evenings in December are likely cooler and the potential surf and ice cream shop might consider reducing operating hours to daytime to reduce costs if demand slows notably. It would be beneficial to provide W. Avy with additional weather data besides just temperature and precipitation. Wind speed would factor heavily into surfing conditions and should be further explored. Another weather phenomena to analyze would be tropical storms and hurricanes, which might make for adventurous surfing conditions, but could be detrimental to the building.
